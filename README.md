# My Favorite Movie
*My favorite movie is Thunderstruck. It is starred by one of my favorite athletes, Kevin Durant. This movie is about a boy who lacks skills in basketball and he idolizes Kevin Durant. Him and KD met in a baskeball game where they suddenly exchanged their basketball skills. After that, Kevin Durant had strings of games where he played poorly, while Brian, the kid became a great basketball player. He even made the varsity team of his school. After Brian realized what happened, he was attacked by his conscience. He decided to meet with Kevin Durant again to give back KD's skills. KD didn't believe it at first, but a thunderstruck suddenly. After that, Brian's championship is coming but he lost his confidence since he was bad at basketball again. Yet, he still played at that game where Kevin Durant watched him. Despite being bad and losing skills, Brian made a game-winner for his team. That's where the movie ended.*
